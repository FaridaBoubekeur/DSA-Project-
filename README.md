# 🏥 Hospital Care Unit Management System – DSA Project
A university-level Data Structures & Algorithms project developed at ENSIA (École Nationale Supérieure d'Intelligence Artificielle). This system simulates and manages the operations of hospital intensive care units (ICUs) using different abstract data types: Hash Tables, Binary Search Trees, and AVL Trees.

# 🩺 Built to handle real-time ICU tasks such as:

Admitting and releasing patients with detailed condition tracking

Simulating vitals (heart rate & blood pressure) in live sessions

Role-based access for Doctors, Nurses, and Hospital Director

Logging and retrieving ICU history and patient files

Managing multiple hospital services (Cardiology, Pneumology, Gynecology)

Benchmarking the performance of different ADT implementations

# 👩‍💻 Developed by:

- Farida Boubekeur (Team Lead)
- Amira Boudaoud
- Wafaa Mers

  
📘 This project emphasizes the practical use of core DSA concepts in a healthcare scenario and includes a modular backend where data structures can be swapped to observe performance differences.
